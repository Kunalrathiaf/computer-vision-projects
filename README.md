# 🧠 Computer Vision Projects with OpenCV

This repository contains implementations of three key computer vision algorithms using OpenCV in Python:

1. **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** – to detect and match keypoints between two images.
2. **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** – to remove outlier keypoint matches and fit a transformation model.
3. **Harris Corner Detector** – to detect and visualize corner points in grayscale images.

## 📌 Project Descriptions

### 1. SIFT Keypoint Detection and Matching
Detects keypoints using the SIFT algorithm and matches them using a brute-force matcher with a ratio test. The result shows correspondences between two images.

### 2. RANSAC for Outlier Removal
Applies RANSAC to filter out incorrect matches from SIFT and estimates a homography (perspective transformation) between two images.

### 3. Harris Corner Detection
Detects corner points in a grayscale image using the Harris algorithm and visualizes them in red.
